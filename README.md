This modpack is inspired by 2 different modpacks. It takes the Hardcoreness of Crash Landings, and it take the survival aspect of Regrowth and they had a child called Rebirth 3. This modpack is a 1.12.2 modpack based around surviving in a wasteland because your ship crashed on a deserted planet and you have to help rebuild, to get materials to fly home.

In this barren wasteland you will find some meterors, which contains rocks and ores from Outer Space. These will get your your basic production of resources. Quests are starting to be included to work your way through the pack.

Hope you Enjoy
